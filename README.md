# face recongnition <br />
&nbsp; We implement face recognition with two different library.<br />
- ### facenet:<br />
&nbsp; [Here](https://github.com/ParsaMohammadpour/face-recognition/blob/main/face_net.ipynb) we implement using facenet library.<br />

- ### face_recognition:<br />
&nbsp; [Here](https://github.com/ParsaMohammadpour/face-recognition/blob/main/face_recognition.ipynb) we implement using face_recognition library. This code was part of conmuper vision project for face detection. We had a some images in a folder (train folder), 
we iterate over train folder (this folder contains a folder for every person in it and in each person's folder, we have multiple images of that person) and read all images, and put all people vector in a dataset and save that. So the next time that we 
have that person image, we can recognize that person. And also we save that dataset information in order not to lose information each time that program stops running.
